<h1>Halifax Foodie</h1>

This is a project I am creating for fun to learn React and Redux.

<hr>

npm install
npm start -s

Found at: localhost:3000

Uses mongoDB with database "mongodb://localhost:27017/haliFoodie" containing collection "restaurants"

Example data to insert into db: <br>
{name="The Bicycle Thief", location="Lower Water Street", rating: 5, comment="Great pasta!"},
{name="2 Doors Down", location="Barrington Street", rating: 4, comment="Great burgers!"}
