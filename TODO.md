TODO:

- [x] Clicking REMOVE with Add Restaurant form open does not update form state properly (FIXED w/ ```componentWillReceiveProps```)
- [ ] Add edit functionality to existing reviews (currently has a button that does nothing)
- [ ] Finish home page - currently all placeholder text/images
- [ ] Add signup/login/profile page 
- [ ] Update contact form to automatically send an email instead of opening email client
- [ ] Fix/finish photo uploading logic
- [ ] Redo star rating component on my own (or find new one) - current library produces warnings in browser
- [ ] Change all images to be my own images instead of images from google
- [ ] Can add duplicate restaurants if whitespace is added anywhere in the title 
- [ ] Does not work if database is not setup - fix this
